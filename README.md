🏨 HOSTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (C Programming)

📄 ABSTRACT

The Hostel Management System is a terminal-based application written in C that allows users to efficiently manage hostel accommodation records.
It provides essential functionalities such as adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting hostel resident details.

All records are stored persistently in a binary file (hostel.txt) ensuring the data remains saved across program runs.

This project demonstrates key C programming concepts including structures, file handling, control flow, loops, and modular programming, making it suitable for beginners, academic projects, and practical learning.
